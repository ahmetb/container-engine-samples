# Sample Web Server application

This directory contains source file for a web server application that responds
to all requests on port 8080 with a page containing details of the request,
response and environment variables of the server. If running on GCE/GKE, it
lists the details about the instance, zone, and project ID.

It is used in various tutorials and examples to demonstrate a HTTP web server
container that returns HTML content and has no additional capabilities.
